# Drive Modes (Rover)

Flight modes (or more accurately "Drive modes" for ground vehicles) provide autopilot support to make it easier to manually drive the vehicle or to execute autonomous missions.

This section outlines all supported drive modes for [Rovers](../frames_rover/index.md).

For information on mapping RC control switches to specific modes see: [Basic Configuration > Flight Modes](../config/flight_mode.md).

Selecting any other mode than those listed below will either stop the rover or can lead to undefined behaviour.
